DAY 1
Friday, May 2 2017
Continued with my intro to CSS on fCC. I did not feel 100% but I struggled through. Easy concepts so far. 

DAY 2
Saturday, May 3 2017
Learned how to override CSS classes. Learned how to set colors using using words, hex, and rgb. Started the first lesson on Bootstrap Responsive. Good stuff.

DAY 3
Sunday, May 4 2017
Another day into Bootstrap. Bootstrap button to be specific. Cool stuff. I keep thinking about the day when I get stuck. Am I going to be able to get unstuck?

DAY 4
Monday, May 5 2017
Allergic reaction today. But I got my hour in after work. I had to miss family dinner though :( Learn about using <span>, <div>, and <i></i> tags. <i> is used to for the Font Awesome icons. Used them on the Cat Photo App. ie <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i>

DAY 5
Tuesday, May 6 2017
Spent almost an hour on one task. I don't know what the deal was. I think it is part my bad and something was wrong with the fCC page itself. Like it wasn't recognizing my code as being proper. I don't know. Fixed my radio buttons and checkboxes on the Cat App using Font Awesome <i> and Bootstrap <class="btn btn-block btn-primary">

DAY 6
Wednesday, May 7 2017
Start the jQuery piece. My local code group does not seem to be too active. I will try to get my hour in during my lunch tomorrow. See what happens.

DAY 7

I got the 1 hour in but besides that I am not able to do any posting. Went to bed at 12:30

DAY 8
Friday, May 9 2017
Started getting into jQuery. It is really powerful. I lot to remember. I have to take notes and periodically read them over. Really enjoying this. Game 4 tonight. Looks like a sweep.
