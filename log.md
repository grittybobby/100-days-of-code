Continued with my intro to CSS on fCC. I did not feel 100% but I struggled through. Easy concepts so far.

Learned how to override CSS classes. Learned how to set colors using using words, hex, and rgb. Started the first lesson on Bootstrap Responsive. Good stuff.

DAY 3

Another day into Bootstrap. Bootstrap button to be specific. Cool stuff. I keep thinking about the day when I get stuck. Am I going to be able to get unstuck?
