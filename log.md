Learned how to override CSS classes. Learned how to set colors using using words, hex, and rgb. Started the first lesson on Bootstrap Responsive. Good stuff.

Another day into Bootstrap. Bootstrap button to be specific. Cool stuff. I keep thinking about the day when I get stuck. Am I going to be able to get unstuck?

DAY 4

Allergic reaction today. But I got my hour in after work. I had to miss family dinner though :( Learn about using <span>, <div>, and <i> tags. <i> is used to for the Font Awesome icons. Used them on the Cat Photo App. ie <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i>
